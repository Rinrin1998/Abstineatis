    "Aesthetically this pitch is amazing. The idea is also very good. I like that Rinus wants to develop this in South Africa where it is needed. I also liked that this will help the developing world as the first world countries already looked after themselves. Great work!"        
    "I feel this is a clever initiative to help business track their business processes. It is not very clear how this business idea would generate revenue." 
    "AWS already provides a similar solution. However, the pitch mentions how the geography problems and will focus on local medium size businesses. Could work."

"Your good idea is based on the fantastic tools you have learned in you studies. However, keep in mind that in South Africa most of the small/medium businesses are labour intensive with low output rates. The bigger guys need these systems but most have them because they cannot operate without them. Some suppliers of plant with higher output rates provide these type of systems. I believe your market is too small to cover your high costs. Your cost will be high simply because you need highly skilled and specialised labour and equipment and have to maintain global networks to complete and update your service offering. Do a market segmentation study and target a nich√© market to avoid the many existing similar  consultants in the market."
